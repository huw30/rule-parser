# Rule Parser

Given a rule string, deserialize it as a NestedRule object for easier traversal, and serialize the NestedRule objects into strings.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
JDK 10.0+
Gradle 4.8
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Gradle: Make sure `gradle` is correctly installed on your machine.

```
brew install gradle
```

can help you with the installation if you are using a Mac Machine.

2. Build

```
gradle build
```

This will generate a build folder under the project.

3. Run

```
gradle run
```

This will run the `main` function from `PlayGround.java`

## Running the tests

```
gradle test
```

The test report can also be accessed from the UI:
`build/reports/tests/test/index.html`
